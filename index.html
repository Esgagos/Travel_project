          The city of Huelva is teeming with history, culture and art. It played
          a crucial role in the discovery of America â€“ some of Columbusâ€™ ships
          were built here, and many of the crew and captains that sailed them
          hailed from these parts. The nearby towns of Moguer and Palos de la
          Frontera bore witness to Christopher Columbusâ€™ preparations, and in
          fact his voyage to the New World set sail from the latter. To top it
          all, Huelva has been influenced throughout time by the Phoenicians,
          the Greeks and the Romans and therefore has an immensely valuable
          heritage. Huelva is waiting to be discovered.

          <h2>Sierra de Aracena and Picos de Aroche Natural Park</h2>
          <p>
            The Sierra de Aracena and Picos de Aroche occupy the western part of
            Sierra Morena where, beaten by humid winds from the Atlantic, are
            home to white villages of cobbled streets, which appear between
            large meadows of holm and cork oaks, organic olive groves, orchards
            and chestnuts. <br /><br />The slate of which it is composed gives
            these mountains a hilly character, with gentle slopes, where large
            valleys of trees alternate with peaks crowned by enclosed woods and
            gorges.

          <h2>Muelle delRio Tinto</h2>
          <p>
            The Rio Tinto Pier (Spanish: Muelle de Rio Tinto) was a commercial
            pier formerly used for the trade of material from the mines of the
            Rio Tinto Company in Andalusia, Spain. It is situated on the River
            Odiel in the city of Huelva. An estimated 150 million tons of ore
            were shipped from the pier over its life. Closed in 1975, it is now
            a popular tourist attraction and fishing spot. The pier is 1165
            meters long, although part of that is built on reclaimed marshland.

            An enormous beach which stretches for 5.5 km from the port of
            MazagÃ³n in the direction of Huelva. It is a very tranquil area. The
            sand is fine and white. The breakwater on which the lighthouse of
            Punta Canaleta stands can be seen from the beach. One section of
            this beach is a naturist area.
